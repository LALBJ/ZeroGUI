    "system_prompt": "You are an expert at analyzing computer usage task completion from screenshots.",
    "user_prompt": "You will be given a task instruction and a series of screenshots of the task execution. \nPlease analyze the screenshots and provide a detailed analysis of the task completion by following the steps below:\n1. First, analyze and understand the task instruction. Describe what should the screenshots look like if the task is completed successfully.\n2. Describe what you observe in each screenshot, analysis what actions were taken and what changes were made to the UI to achieve the task (or mistakes made).\n3. When you analyze the screenshots, please pay attention to the very detailed elements and changes in the UI. Every small detail may affect the final result.\n4. After all screenshots are analyzed, provide a overall reasoning about how the task was completed or failed at **the final state**. Make sure you have considered all demands of the task instruction.\n5. Determine if the task was completed at **the final state** (the last screenshot) successfully (score 1 for success, 0 for failure). If the task is completed during the process but not at the final state, it should be considered as failure (0 score).\n\nProvide your response strictly in the following format:\nTASK REQUIREMENT:\n[Your understanding of the task instruction]\n\nSCREENSHOT ANALYSIS:\nScreenshot 1:\n[Analysis of first screenshot]\nScreenshot 2:\n[Analysis of second screenshot]\n...\n\nREASONING:\n[Your reasoning]\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n[Your final answer]\n\nSCORE: [0/1]\n\nHere is an example:\n(Task Instruction: Please help me backup my emails in \"Bills\" folder in Thunderbird and store the .eml files with only subject names to my Google Drive folder called \"emails\".)\n\nTASK REQUIREMENT:\n- Backup the emails in \"Bills\" folder in Thunderbird.\n- Store the backup .eml files with only subject names, and the emails should be saved in the Google Drive folder called \"emails\".\n- Once succeed, the emails should be visible in the Google Drive folder \"emails\". Or at least there should be a saving action performed.\n\nSCREENSHOT ANALYSIS:\n\nScreenshot 1:\n- Thunderbird email client is open.\n- The \"Bills\" folder is visible under \"Local Folders.\"\n- There is no observable action performed yet in this screenshot.\n\nScreenshot 2:\n- The \"Bills\" folder has been selected, and the folder content is displayed.\n- Two emails are visible: \"Amazon Web Services Invoice Available\" and \"Your receipt from X (formerly Twitter).\"\n- No further actions are taken on the emails.\n\nScreenshot 3:\n- Both emails in the \"Bills\" folder are selected.\n- Content previews of both emails are displayed on the right-hand side.\n- No observable attempt to export or save the emails is visible.\n\nScreenshot 4:\n- The right-click context menu is accessed for the selected emails.\n- The \"Save As...\" option is hovered over, indicating intent to save the selected emails.\n\nScreenshot 5:\n- The file navigation window opens, allowing the user to choose a save destination.\n- No specific Google Drive folder (e.g., \"emails\") is accessed or visible in this screenshot.\n\nScreenshot 6:\n- The \"Desktop\" option in the file picker is hovered over.\n- Still no indication of Google Drive folder (\"emails\") selection.\n\nScreenshot 7:\n- The \"Show other locations\" option is hovered over in the file picker.\n- No confirmation that the user is navigating to Google Drive or saving the files with subject names only.\n\nScreenshot 8:\n- The \"Software Updates Available\" notification appears. The file picker is still open without any observable confirmation of file saving or destination selection.\n- It remains unclear where or if the emails have been saved.\n\nREASONING:\nBased on the screenshots provided:\n1. While there was some intent to save the emails (as shown by the selection and access of the \"Save As...\" function), there is no confirmation that the .eml files were saved with subject names only and placed in the required Google Drive folder (\"emails\").\n2. The screenshots lack evidence of the completion of the task as per the instructions.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\nThe task was not completed successfully due to the lack of observable saving action.\n\nSCORE: 0\n\nNow, please **strictly follow the format** and analyze the following screenshots (The last line should only be SCORE: [0/1], no other text):\nTask Instruction: {instruction}\nScreenshots (by order):\n",
